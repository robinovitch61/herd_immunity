    "\n",
    "1. Number of agents is **GRID_WIDTH * GRID_HEIGHT = NUM_AGENTS**. Each point in the rectangular grid is occupied by an agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Agents are randomly assigned an **IMMUNE** status, either 0 (susceptible) or 1 (immune), at the beginning. **NUM_IMMUNE_START = PERC_IMMUNE_START * NUM_AGENTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Agents are initially randomly flagged as sick, with **NUM_SICK_START = PERC_SICK_START * NUM_AGENTS.** Immune agents cannot be initially flagged as sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. All agents that aren't immune or sick are deemed healthy intially.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. At each period, agents connect with some of the agents around them, with probability of connecting to agents within their **CONNECTION_DISTANCE** being determined by some function. This determines the candidate pool a given agent could connect with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. If **CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 1**, agents have a candidate pool of  <= 8, that is, the agents directly around them in a square with themself at the center. Probability of connecting with each agent in this pool is determined by some function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. If **CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 2,** agents have a candidate pool of <= 16, that is, the agents directly around them in 2 concentric squares with themself at the center. Probability of connecting with each agent in this pool is determined by some function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. etc. with **CONNECTION_DISTANCE <= MAX(GRID_WIDTH, GRID_HEIGHT) - 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If a sick agent connects with a healthy agent who is not immune, probability of infection is **PROB_INFECTION.** If a sick agent connects with an immune agent, probability of infection is zero (could change later accounting for imperfect vaccination success rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. After **PERIODS_SURVIVED** periods, sick agents die and no longer pose a threat to healthy agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If after **PERIODS_FOR_STABILITY**, number of sick agents has not increased, the population is said to be stable and simulation ends."
